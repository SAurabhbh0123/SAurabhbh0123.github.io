# About Me
Hello! I'm Saurabh kala, a passionate student, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications. I'm working on various projects and assignments to enhance and polish my programming skills plus improvising my command over other Technical Skills. Having a keen interest in working with Python, my goal is to master Python and use it to solve real-world challenges.

# Projects

### [1.Tic-Tac-Toe GUI](https://github.com/SAurabhbh0123/tic-tac-toe-GUI)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with "X" or "O." The goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game ends with a win, draw, or when all spaces are filled. Optimal play often results in a draw.

### [2.GUI-Calculator](https://github.com/SAurabhbh0123/GUI-Calculator)

A GUI Calculator is a user-friendly application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Built using Python libraries like tkinter or PyQt, it features buttons for digits, operations, and clear/reset functions. It displays input and results in a text box, mimicking a physical calculator.

### [3.Car-Price-Predication](https://github.com/SAurabhbh0123/car-price-predication)

Car price prediction uses machine learning to estimate the price of a vehicle based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and condition. It involves analyzing historical sales data to identify patterns and relationships between attributes and prices. Algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks are often employed. Accurate predictions help buyers, sellers, and businesses make informed decisions in the automobile market.

### [4. Olympic Analysis](https://github.com/SAurabhbh0123/olympics-analysis)

Olympic analysis examines data from past and current Olympic Games to identify trends, performance metrics, and key insights. It includes studying athletesâ€™ performances, medal tallies, country rankings, and event-specific outcomes. Advanced analytics can predict future results, assess the impact of training techniques, or explore geopolitical influences. Such insights support decision-making for athletes, coaches, and organizations.
